# Class Dynamic
Wednesdays will be our day for in depth discussion of questions, doubts and problems you may have with the concepts seen so far or any pending problem set.

## Participation in class is key:
* For every six (6) questions asked in class you get a 1% bonus to your Term grade.
* For every six (6) asked within the same week, you get double bonus, 2%.
* If you keep that pace for full 4 weeks, you get 10% bonus to your Term grade. To be sure we understand the requirements: for the span of 4 weeks, every week you ask in class 6 or more questions.
* Questions asked during Wednesdays' general problems discussion count only half: That is, every 2 questions adds one to your weekly bonus balance.

Note: Participation bonus-points are not accumulable with any other point offer (;-) nor prorated to the following term.

Recommendation: Classes have a rather tight duration. In order to have a chance to ask 2-3 questions each student, you should come with a list of concrete questions written down well ahead of the class period. You should be able to promptly and clearly state your question.

# End of Year Project
This will count 30% to your end of year grade.

Eventually, you may split this 30% between a project and a final exam.

## Important Deadlines on the Course Project

1. By Thursday April 19th 2018 you must have narrowed down the list to 3 topics.
1. By Thursday April 26th 2018 you must have committed to one project.
1. By Friday June 1st 2018 you must choose whether you want to do as well a Final Exam -and thus split that 30%. 
1. Final Project submission deadline: Wednesday June 6th (Eventually, extendable to Wednesday June 13th 2018; base on case by case depending on reasons). If you submit AFTER June 6th, you won't have a chance to discuss with me possible changes and fix them. After June 13th, no project will be accepted and you will have to do the final exam worth 30% of your course grade.
